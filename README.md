reference:
    - filePenguin: aaa, aaa
    - nolesdrive: aaa, aaa@aaa,aaa
# todo:
    - validate and sanitize sign up form
    - test different types of files(working: .docx, .pdf, .txt)
    - Work on actions:
        - (preview) => prety big task 
        - share -> share, copy link => have no idea yet
        - organize -> move => have no idea yet but we can just add  to folders that they are not in
    - try to figure out shared with me and shared in general, save for later
    - Add search function and the filters functionality
Bug: 
    - uploading file, renaming, and downloading causes errors
    - ! can we upload multiple files with the same name? = Yes
