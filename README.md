    - validate and sanitize sign up form
    - test different types of files(working: .docx, .pdf, .txt)
    - Work on actions:
        - (preview) => prety big task 
        - share -> share, copy link => have no idea yet
        - organize -> move => have no idea yet but we can just add  to folders that they are not in
    - try to figure out shared with me and shared in general, save for later
    - Add search function and the filters functionality
    - !!! LET's leave folder alone for now
    -> Error when uploading diff files not supported
